Use that reddit data set, along with nltk (natural language tool kit)

Use nltk to parse the reddit dataset and generate lists of adjectives, nouns, and verbs. nltk also has different "corpas" of data,
one of which may contain a lot of the "modern" nouns we're looking for. 

Then randomly peice together an adjective and a noun, adjective and verb, etc. To form a two-part username (maybe three part?)
this is where markov chains might come in handy to combine the two/three in a sensible way. 

Maybe be able to insert an adjective that you know you want and have it add onto the user-given data to create a username.
